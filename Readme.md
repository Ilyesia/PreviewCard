## Process
For this challenge I mainly applied Flexbox to help maintain the projects alignment. I started the challenge styling around the mobile format with that in mind the usage of a container element allowed me to modify media queries easily for the site to adjust to desktop and larger formats. Overall a major focus on individual CSS properties.

## Tools Used

* CSS
* Google Fonts

## What I Learned
This was my first real test of my CSS and HTML abilities allowing me to better understand the language and understanding how to apply it in a real-world setting.
